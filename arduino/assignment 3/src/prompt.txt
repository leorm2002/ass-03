you have to build a system based on arduino to control a servo motor.
The system will have:
a button (the presson of the button must be attatched to an hardware interrupt)
a potentiometer
a servo motor as output
a lcd
it will also take input from serial line from a computer (values from 0 to 100)

The system will have two state manual and automatic, the state are switched each time the button is pressed. The default state is automatic
When in automatic the arduino will recieve a value via serial (the recievement of the message must be handlet with an interrupt) ranging from 0 to 100. it will then map it to a value from 0 to 180 and set the servo to the specified degree

If the system is in maual mode it will check the potentiometer and move the servo from 0 to 180 degrees base on the position of the potentiometer.

You can choose which pin to use.
The progam must be un multiple files, use c++.
Make a wrap header and class for each component (servo, potentiometer, button, lcd and serial i/o)
and manage the system with as basic finite state machine (with the two given state)

In any given time the display must always show:
the mode (manual automatic) the degree of opening of the servo.
Remember to use an hardware interrupt for the pin

the directory structure must be like:
- src
  - main.ino
  - ServoController.h
  - ServoController.cpp
  - Potentiometer.h
  - Potentiometer.cpp
  - Button.h
  - Button.cpp
  - Display.h
  - Display.cpp
  - SerialIO.h
  - SerialIO.cpp
  - FSM.h
  - FSM.cpp
